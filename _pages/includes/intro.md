I am Dou Hu, an Assistant Professor at the State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication, Communication University of China (CUC). 
Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE CAS), under the supervision of [**Prof. Songlin Hu**](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~husonglin?language=en). 


My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning. 
My research goal is to develop more intelligent, efficient, and trustworthy AI systems for language understanding and generation. 
To achieve this, I am currently focused on general representation learning to enhance language models' generalization, robustness, trustworthiness, and safety, particularly in representation learning theory and trustworthy large language models (LLMs).
