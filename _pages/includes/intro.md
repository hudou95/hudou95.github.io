I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE, CAS), under the supervision of [**Prof. Songlin Hu**](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~husonglin?language=en). 
I completed my bachelor's degree in Physics from Shenzhen University and my master's degree in Software Engineering from National Computer System Engineering Research Institute of China (joint program with UCAS). 
Prior to my Ph.D., I worked as an Algorithm Researcher at Ping An.

My research interests include natural language processing and machine learning. 
My research goal is to enable AI to better understand and generate human language. To achieve this, I am currently focused on representation learning principles and techniques to enhance the generalization, robustness, efficiency, and trustworthiness of language models.
