I am Dou Hu, an Assistant Professor at [Communication University of China (CUC)](https://en.cuc.edu.cn/). 
Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) and the [Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IIE CAS)](https://www.iie.ac.cn/) in 2025, under the supervision of [**Prof. Songlin Hu**](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~husonglin?language=en). 

My research interests include **natural language processing** and **machine learning**. 
My research goal is to develop more intelligent, efficient, and trustworthy AI systems for language understanding and generation. 
To achieve this, I am currently focused on text representation learning to enhance language models' generalization, robustness, trustworthiness, and safety, particularly in **representation learning theory** and **trustworthy large language models**.  

Feel free to reach out to hudou [AT] cuc.edu.cn if you have anything you would like to discuss.
